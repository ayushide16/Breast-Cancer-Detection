# Breast Cancer Detection
This repository contains a comprehensive project focused on detecting breast cancer using machine learning techniques. By leveraging the power of machine learning, this project seeks to aid in the early detection and diagnosis of breast cancer, ultimately contributing to better patient outcomes.

## Project Overview
Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers affecting women worldwide. Early detection is crucial for effective treatment and improving survival rates. This project utilizes a machine learning approach to build a predictive model that can identify breast cancer based on features extracted from medical images.

## Key Features
1. Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the dataset for analysis, including handling missing values, feature scaling, and encoding categorical variables.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing the data to understand the distribution of features and uncover patterns or correlations.
3. Feature Engineering: Creating new features and selecting the most relevant ones to improve model performance.
4. Model Building: Implementing and comparing various machine learning algorithms, including Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines, and Naive Bayes.
5. Model Evaluation: Assessing the models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC curve to ensure their effectiveness.
6. Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimizing the model parameters to enhance performance.

## Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn
Tools: Jupyter Notebook
